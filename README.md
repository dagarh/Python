# Python #

An interpreted **language**, **Python** has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows **programmers** to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
